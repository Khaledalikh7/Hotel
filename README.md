# Hotel
This is a Dashboard report using Power_BI is called Hotel, This dashboard provides insights into the hotel performance on period (2014-2017)

I collected the raw data and then Extracted from it questions
to go through the Analysis process 

the important questions was about :

-The stay
-reservation statuses 
-reserved and assigned rooms
-average rental revenue earned(ADR)
-meal plans

The next stage was processing and cleaning the raw data
using Power_Query and then visualizing the data
using power bi to get useful insights
